# NeuronalTauAnalysis
A pipeline to investigate tau (total tau and phosphorylated tau) within neurons in a region-sepcific manner (via immunohistochemisty stainings).
Please find the code as well as a user manual and examples above. With the code you can determine region-specific pTau and/or total tau expression as well as the ratio of pTau and total tau (if you stained for both).

Info: The code can be used for the analysis of any other staining within neurons.

_Left panel shows the original image with MAP2 (grey), AT8 (red) and total tau (green) staining. Middle panel shows thresholded MAP2-channel. Right panel shows overlay of ROIs for the nucleus (green), the soma (blue) and dendrites (yellow). Scale bar: 20 Âµm._
